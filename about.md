<p>Management Information Systems student at the The University of Akron graduating 
December 2018. </p>

<br>
Hello! I am senior Information Systems Management (MIS) student at the University of Akron with a variety of work experience and campus involvement. I am currently finishing up my last semester at the University of Akron before I start as an Associate Big Data Software Developer at CardinalCommerce in January 2019.

This is a mouthful, but I have professional experience with Python, SQL, C#, Java, Scala, C++, R, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Spring MVC, AJAX, REST, jQuery, .NET, PowerShell, neo4j, Linux, Apache Spark, AWS S3 / EC2 / SES, Apache Airflow, Elastic Stack, Kafka, Agile Environment, MS SQL Server, MySQL, Atlassian Stack, MS Office, Visual Studio, Git, SVN, and probably more that I've forgot to list off.

Please feel free to email me at zmn3@zips.uakron.edu with any questions, potential projects, requests, etc.

Thanks!
