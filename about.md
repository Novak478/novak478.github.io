<h2>About Me </h2>
I am currently working as a Data Engineer on the Machine Learning team at Progressive Insurance in Mayfield Heights, OH (remotely). My primary work projects have been contributing to model serving APIs, infrastructure as code development, working with [Prefect](prefect.io), advancing innersource projects, and consulting work to bring data engineering to other groups throughout Progressive.

I graduated with my Bachelors in Information Systems Management at the University of Akron in December 2018, summa cum laude and was selected as 2018-2019's "Outstanding Information Systems Management Undergraduate Graduate".
