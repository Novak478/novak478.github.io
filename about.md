<p>Zack of all trades, master of none</p>

<br>
Hello! I am a December 2018 graduate of the University of Akron, graduating with a Bachelors of Business Administration in Management Information Systems. I have a plethora of hobbies, and like to think of myself as a do-it-all DIY kind of guy. 

I mainly have professional experience with:

- Python
- Apache Airflow
- Apache Spark
- Apache Kafka
- Databricks
- Java
- Spring MVC
- SQL / MySQL
- AJAX, REST, jQuery
- REST

This is a mouthful, but I also have experience with C#, Scala, C++, R, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, .NET, PowerShell, neo4j, Linux, Apache Spark, AWS S3 / EC2 / SES, Elastic Stack, Agile Environment, Atlassian Stack, MS Office, Visual Studio, Git, SVN, and probably more that I've forgot to list off.

Please feel free to email me at admin@stopignoring.me with any questions, potential projects, requests, etc.

Thanks!
