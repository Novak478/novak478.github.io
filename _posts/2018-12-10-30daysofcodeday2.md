## Summary:

This update is meant to cover what I did for day 2 of my 30 days of code.

Total changes:

- Followed Corey's example to create a sql database in sqlite using flask-sqlalchemy.
- Implemented a sqlite database and created some fake data.
- Troubleshooted an issue with pylint and sqlite (had to add sqlalchemy to ignored modules list)
- Created two initial tables, following corey's structure.

## Day 2

So for day 2, I followed along Corey Schafer's Flask Tutorial - Part 4 and created a sql lite database using the flask-sqlalchemy module. It was a pretty light day as I actually took MY LAST COLLEGE FINAL today in organizational behavior, and also helped my girlfriend with her laptop for a few hours (her laptop wouldn't turn on - had to troubleshoot, and debug while also keeping her calm. Ended up having to reseat her on switch's connection to the motherboard).

So yeah! Tomorrow I plan on playing around with AWS's getting started guide to gear the project more towards what I want before I continue along with Corey's flask tutorials. Thanks for reading!
