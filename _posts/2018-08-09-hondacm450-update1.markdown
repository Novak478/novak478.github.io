## Summary:

Update 1 on a new motorcycle I picked up - 1983 Honda CM450A 'Hondamatic'.

---

## Intro

Hello everybody,
this is my first post into my 1983 Honda CM450A Hondamatic project. I’m really just going to be having fun with it, and learning as I go. I am going to go for a more true cruiser / chopper image. For reference, I am starting with a completely stock bike and looking to customize it as I go and include the brands I use / where I bought it from in case anyone else is looking for something to use for their cm400/450.

Just to tune it up and get a rolling calendar for future repairs going I made some repairs below.
Everything was bought off of 4into1.com except for the fuel filter and oil. 4into1 specializes in vintage Japanese motorcycles. They are also on ebay.com, but it is cheaper to buy it directly from them. Great experience. Only company I have dealt with that has their “free shipping” being priority 2 day. 

-	The air filter $9.95. SKU: 12-91400, Emgo Stock Air Filter 
-	The oil filter $3.95. SKU: OF-01, Unbranded Honda oil filter/
-	Added a fuel filter that was $5.25 for three off of eBay. It is an inline carburetor fuel filter – ¼” 6mm-7mm bought from seller “blessing2011*2011”. 
-	Changed oil $23.89. Model: Genuine Honda 4 Stroke oil 10w-40 from my local Honda dealership
-	Replaced spark plugs $2.50 each, model: NGK D8EA
-	Replaced front and rear tire $164.75, models: Kenda K657 challenger set (tires and new valves)
From 4into1, I also bought but did not yet use: new front brake pads (BikeMaster, SKU 96-1130, $18.95, a genuine Honda black fuel line 5.5mm (genuine, 95001-55008-60M-1, $2.75), a Motorcycle chain 530 (102 links - Parts Unlimited, T530-102, $21.95), and a stainless steel carburetor Allen bolt set (unbranded, SS-9027, $5.95).
I bought those parts as I plan on rebuilding / cleaning the carburetor’s at a later date as well as swapping out all of the JIS bolts (old and easy to strip / get stuck) with new Allen bolts. Additionally, I have inspected the current chain and sprockets, and they look solid, so I do not think I need to replace them yet. Same goes with the front brake pads.
I also added a backrest from a 1978 Honda Cm185T Twinstar. It was mainly a direct fit, but I will not swap out for larger ‘U’ bolts to really lock onto the handrest.

        <p>Photo of new front tire. Old front tire was showing signs of dry rot from sitting. Did everything myself but seal the bead - I do not recommend doing the "starter fluid and lighter" method, and I do not have an air compressor powerful enough to do it. Any mechanic shop who does tires usually will have no problem sealing the bead for you. Shout out to Monroe Muffler and the manager Bob for taking care of me there. $5 for mount and balance.</p>

## Cruise after I just bought it

Head to 7:45 to see me pin it at 70 mph, otherwise it's just a video of me driving around.
