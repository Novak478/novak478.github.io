## Summary:

This update is meant to cover what I did for week 1 of my 30 days of code.

Total changes:

- Created custom error pages
- Created login and registration system
- Restructured application to be modular and allow for better separation of features as well as multiple instances of application to be running. 
- Probably more stuff too.

## Week 1

So week 1 is finished, and in this week I watched tutorials and programmed for roughly 9 hours. The videos themselves were only around 6, but with troubleshooting, installation, reading and actually understanding what I am using, it came out to be roughly 9. So I hit my goal of 7 hours in week 1! Which is great. I did not program at all on Saturday due to graduation, so I am happy to still have hit my goal.

Going into week 2, I will tailor the web application more closely to what I actually want stop ignoring me to be. Additionally, I will start integrating AWS into it.

So far, I can defintely see myself using:

- S3
- SES
- SMS
- EC2
- Lambda
- Redshift
- Elastic Beanstalk
- DynamoDB

That may be overkill, but again, the purpose of this project is to learn. Actual businesses use AWS, and I want to learn what each product actually does as well as how to implement / maintain it.

A quick video on how it's looking now:

Thanks!
