## 30 Days Of Code

Alright so here's the deal. Day 11, I moved back home to my hometown of Painesville, Ohio because my job is in the town over and is a 12 minute drive compared to a 1-2 hour drive from my apartment in Akron. The thing is that my brother was home from London, and had taken over my room as his base of command while he was home. That's cool and all I thought, I'll just use this time while he's home to look into my database design, and watch  some Udemy courses I've been putting off for a hot minute. 

Well, here's the deal while I was doing the database design. My website, stopignoring.me is going to be a personal website. It's going to host Personal Identifiable Information (PII), and while this is a fun project that I don't expect to host a ton of people on, it is still PII data...and I didn't (and stil don't) feel comfortable putting the rest of my code on public display. Everything in the database is currently salted and hashed, and protected by special users with distinct priviledges, but yeah. That's whats up. This is a fun project, but it's unfortunately taken some serious turns with just how it's intended to be used. 

I can however proudly say that I am almost finished with the "Learning Python for Data Analysis" by Jose Portilla - I highly recommend it if you want to become more comfortable with pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit. For $12, it's been a good purchase.

Thanks for following along so far - I am looking forward to the day I can post on here that stopignoring.me is fully up and running!
