## Summary:

Update 2 on my 1983 Honda CM450A 'Hondamatic'.

---

## Intro

Hello everybody,
this is my second post on my 1983 Honda CM450A Hondamatic project. I've made a few changes to the bike since last time, and am planning a major rehaul in the next update!

This next update will include (hopefully):

- Repainting of gas tank to matte black.
- New 7/8" pullback, 70s chopper handlebars
- New grips from Biltwell.
- Rebuild carbs with kit. 
- Change air intake to pods.
- Relocate battery / clean up system around air intake 
- Relocate electric start and killswitch.
- Chop the rear fender with an angle grinder
- Minimize rear tail light (change style and remove turn signals)
- Relocate license plate

So, the stock mufflers had to go. They were cool back in the 80s, and were very quiet, but I wanted some fishtails - so I got some fishtails! I acquired these off of oldbikebarn.com. It was a pretty tight fit, and I am considering buying a 1 5/8" to 1 3/4" adapter, but right now the exhaust is held on pretty tight with some simple exhaust clamps from Advanced Auto Parts.

Total things changed in this update:

- Fish Tail 29 Inch H-D Muffler. Came out to be around ~$105 total for a pair. Link is here: https://www.oldbikebarn.com/chopper/fish-tail-29-inch-h-d-muffler.html
- I finally replaced the rear tire myself (same process as I did with the front - remove, pop bead, take off, clean, put new tire on, bring in to shop to seal and balance).
- Removed the front fender.
- Removed chain guard.
- Changed tire valve stem caps to some sweet 99 cent dice ones off of eBay.
