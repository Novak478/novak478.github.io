# Overview

I bought a 1998 Harley-Davidson Sportster XL883 the other day. It's everything that I wanted and it sucks. It calls out to me like a siren during the workday. It haunts my dreams at night.

## My two cents

Every bike I've owned besides my previous one (a 2006 Honda Rebel) I've tried to make look like a cruiser. It was awesome on one hand because I ended up getting some really rad, unique bikes that caught eyes and were full of stories at motorcycle meet ups as well as swap meets. It was maddening because at the end at the end of the day, everything was custom. Different bolt sizes everywhere. Nothing standardized. This forced me to learn a lot, but reduced the "joy" owning a motorcycle heavily I found at the end.

Case in point, my 1983 Honda CM450A near the end.

I ended up donating that to the Skidmark Garage in Cleveland for their Motogo program. I messed it up.

Last year, I bought a 2006 Honda Rebel 250. I just wanted a stock bike that was easy to ride, easy to work on, and with plenty of spare parts. It's been everything I wanted! I can go up to 65 mph and get 60 miles to the gallon. It's super light. Maintenance is a piece of cake between it's one carb and no oil filter.

After 1500+ miles though, I realized I had wore myself out on it. I couldn't go two up on it with my girlfriend. I could never go past 65 mph comfortably. It was bland. It has no personality to it. To it's credit, that's exactly what it's supposed to be and shout out to Honda for designing one hell of a machine. But again, I wanted more.

Enough was enough I decided - time to just buy a damn sportster. Two days later, here I am.

## Experience so far

Like before, maddening. Also lovely.

### Kickstand tab issue

Alright so this sucked. I rented a motorcycle Uhaul trailer for $25 and it's rad. Built in wheel chock, higher and cheaper insurance incase you get into an accident, lower ramp height, etc. If you ever need to move a motorcycle, I recommend doing this. You can even rent a van through Uhaul or get a truck from a hardware store to pull the trailer in case you dont want to you use your personal vehicle. In the future, I'll probably be doing this just to ease concerns about towing in my Subaru.

So why did it suck? Well, there were multiple things that went wrong.

I was having trouble backing the trailer into the seller's driveway so I opted to just park it on the street and then walk it up. This was a mistake. The reason being is that Sportster's have low ground clearance and the trailer's ramp angle was high due to parking on the street. No matter what we did, we would have most likely scraped the frame. If we had walked it up, we could've caught it and adjusted. This is not what happened.

Instead, I rode the motorcycle to the ramp and then turned it off, intending to push it up with the help of my friend. The seller then offered to drive it up the ramp, stating that he had done it plenty of times before. I said OK, sure what the hell. It's worth mentioning at this point that I had already signed the title over to me and had paid the cash. This bike was mine. I never should have allowed him to do this as I have no legal recourse. I'm taking it as a learnign experience.

What ended up happening next was that when he rode it up, the grate on the ramp caught the bottom side of the motorcycle and made a loud, screeching noise similar to that of nails on a chalkboard before getting on the trailer. We all went ghostly white, and inspected the bike and confirmed that the tension spring for the kickstand was no longer attached. Nothing else happened. No one knew how it attached at the time and since the bike was supported by the kickstand on the ramp, I said it's fine - i'll fix it later. Can't be a big deal. In hindsight it is and isn't but it was scary and later annoying!

This is apparently a fairly common occurrence after researching it lone. This comforted me and gave me several ways to solve it, but on that note: terrible design. Compared to every other motorcycle I've owned, this is the first time I've seen the kickstand spring attached directly under the motorcycle's frame to a welded tab. On my Honda Rebel, the spring is attached directly to the top of the kickstand mount - that style would've avoided the probably entirely. Again, shout out to Honda's engineering.

#### Solution

What I ended up doing after reading online was to fabricate a solution using a #7 drill and a 1/4-20 tap. This is because the local Harley-Davidson dealership recommended replacing the whole frame and that was out of scope for me.

The combo I used was similar to: [https://www.menards.com/main/tools/hand-tools/taps-dies/bosch-reg-7-drill-bit-and-1-4-x-20-nc-tap-set/21666/p-1444452366659.htm](https://www.menards.com/main/tools/hand-tools/taps-dies/bosch-reg-7-drill-bit-and-1-4-x-20-nc-tap-set/21666/p-1444452366659.htm).

This was my first time doing this and lordy lordy did it show. I drilled three holes, and the third time was the charm coincidentally.

The first hole was directly in the old kickstand bung. I figured this would be the most plug and play spot as I knew the tension spring connecting the kickstand to the frame would work here. The drill went smoothly as did the tap I was using, but I over torqued the bolt head and snapped the head off. Unless I wanted to now somehow extract a screw from the bolt, this hole was damned. On the plus side, I don't need to worry about rust there as I filled that hole.

The second hole was too low. I measured it out, but didn't account for the tension spring adjusting. When all was said and done, the kickstand didn't "snap" back to the rubber stopper holding it in place, but instead hung about 2" down. This worried me that I'd lose the spring on a hard bump and/or would distract me while riding. I didn't want to constantly be checking this so I opted for a third whole.

The third hole is directly in the frame, parallel to the kickstand bung about 1" away. This was the easiest hole to drill as a Sportster's tubing is only about 1.25" thick compared to the solid kickstand holes.

In the future, I'll probably have an independent shop weld a new kickstand with an internal spring onto my frame and then seal the hole I made. My solution has held up after 50+ miles in the mean time though, so I'm confident it can make it. God bless and damn blue loctite.

### Neighbor's coming out from the weeds

Some of my neighbor's that I've never talked to before suddenly are coming by asking about the bike and telling me stories of their own as well as just hanging out when I'm wrenching on it. It's nice. I guess they finally decided "well damn, this guy is alright" haha.

I've also had one neighbor jokingly state that he saw I got a Harley and then that he really liked my Honda for how quite it is with a wink. I got the hint.

+3/-1 isn't too bad in my book I suppose...

### Getting hit on

One of the truly more bizarre, but positive(?) perks though has been getting hit on by the biker mamas out there. It's happened three times now which doesn't seem like a lot, but if this trend continues, I'm getting hit on 25% of the time I ride.

I've never been on Tinder or any other dating app before, but if I did, I guess one of my pictures would have a picture of the bike in it lol.

## Modifications made so far

-   Oil Change
-   Burly Bro Slammer Shocks
-   TC Bros king and queen seat
-   TC Bros sissy bar
-   TC Bros 3.5" lift kit
-   TC Bros Skid plate (because I'm paranoid about Northeast Ohio's roads and the ground clearance)
-   New spark plugs
-   Dice valve stem covers cause why not

## Future modifications

I plan on adding changing the handlebar grips, adding pullback handlebars, relocating the clutch cable, and adding a Trident Cycles mini breadbox air cleaner. Essentially building a mini chopper.
